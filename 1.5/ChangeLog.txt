1.4.0	{all}		[!] Added prepared metadata feature for generated classes 
			    by BNComplier and highly improved performance (Reflection API is minimized).
			    A coding/encoding performance is increased up to 80-100 times.
			    Older style only with metadata is supported too.
			    Big thanks to John Finley for ideas and cool performance test.
